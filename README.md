# Water Monitoring System for Hydroponics Agriculture 🌱💧

This is an academic project developed as part of the final year engineering curriculum at  
**K.L.E. Dr. M.S. Sheshgiri College of Engineering and Technology, Belagavi**, under the guidance of **Prof. Sushant Jadhav**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Hydroponics is a technique of growing plants without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in water. Our project focuses on monitoring critical parameters in a hydroponics setup:

- Water temperature
- Soil moisture
- Water level
- Light exposure
- Nutrient regulation

These parameters are monitored and controlled using **Raspberry Pi**, sensors, and actuators to ensure optimal growth of plants.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Components Used

- **Raspberry Pi 3**
- **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Air Pump**
- **Plant Growth LED Lights**
- **LCD Display**
- **pH & EC monitoring (via Microcontrollers)**

## 📋 Methodology

Using microcontrollers and sensors, the system monitors:
- **pH**
- **Electrical Conductivity**
- **Water luminosity**

Lights are turned ON/OFF using a timer (16h ON, 8h OFF), pH is constantly monitored and nutrients are adjusted accordingly. Data is also sent to an LCD/terminal.
